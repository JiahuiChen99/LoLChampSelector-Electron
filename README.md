## Architecture
This client is build using NodeJS & Electron :electron: framework.

It uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) protocol to communicate with the server. The underlying data sent to the back-end are Google's
Protocol Buffers.


> Structure for sending users' messages to the server. It is also used for champions' abilities retrieval.
```
// Simple message
message Message {

    string message = 1;

}
```


> Fetch champions' abilities
```
// Request a champion's ability
message championAbilityRequest {

    string champion = 1;
    string ability = 2;

}
```

> Response from the server with the champion.
```
// Chatbot response
message chatbotResponse {

    string message = 1;
    string champion = 2;

}
```


Currently only 2 rpc are implemented

> Sends the user message, awaits chatbot's response
```
rpc send_message(Message) returns (chatbotResponse);
```

> Fetches champion' abilities, the champion name and the ability are required.
```
rpc getChampionAbility(championAbilityRequest) returns (Message);
```
